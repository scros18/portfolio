# 🔐 Environment Variables Guide

## What's This For?

Your Discord webhook URL is now stored securely in the `.env` file instead of being hardcoded in the source code. This keeps your webhook private and makes it easy to change.

---

## 📁 Files Created

1. **`.env`** - Contains your actual webhook (NEVER commit this to Git!)
2. **`.env.example`** - Template for others (safe to commit)

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### During Development:
- The code uses `process.env.DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL`
- TypeScript compiles to JavaScript

### During Build:
- `npm run build` reads your `.env` file
- Injects the webhook URL directly into the code
- Obfuscates everything for production

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

✅ `.env` is in `.gitignore` (your webhook is safe!)  
✅ The webhook gets embedded during build (no runtime loading)  
✅ Build output is obfuscated (hard to reverse engineer)

---

## 📝 Changing Your Webhook

1. Open `.env`
2. Replace the URL after `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=`
3. Run `npm run build`
4. Deploy the new build!

---

## 🌐 VPS Deployment

When deploying to your VPS, just create a `.env` file there:

```bash
cd /var/www/sam-portfolio
nano .env
```

Paste:
```
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_WEBHOOK_HERE
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
npm run build
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT

- **NEVER** commit `.env` to Git
- **ALWAYS** use `.env.example` for documentation
- **REBUILD** after changing the webhook URL

Your webhook is now secured! 🔐✨
